Simple script that gives you the streaming status without actually streaming.
Replace `"TOKEN"` with your discord token.
Replace `"URL"` with any Twitch/Youtube address.
You can change your streaming status by typing in any discord text channel `$stream text-that-you-want`.

`pip install discord.ext.context==0.1.6` <br />
`pip install discord.py==1.7.3`
